cs257 Final project plan


Our dataset: Top 5000 albums of all time

How should we go about planning this?

Principles to keep in mind:

- be user-friendly
- don't be visibly noisy
- make things simple; people don't like feeling stupid
- dont overload the page with information
- 4 clicks to get anywhere on the site (navigation tools possibly?)
    - could use a drop-down menu to keep things visually sparse

- Make it obvious what the site is for
-
