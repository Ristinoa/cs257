Context for Wireframe image

Authors: A.J. Ristino & Julian Bowers

Our wireframe consists of a singular page (the homepage) of our hypothetical webapp

The homepage has four major functions: 

   I.Advanced search:
   
       Functions as described in the use case, perhaps we should rename it to just 'search'?

       Functions as a checklist--get tags design. If a user selects an option, they'll then be
       prompted to enter partial strings to add tags to their search (like autofill in google)


   II. ENTRIES FOUND:

       Displays a list of all entries satisfying the search criteria.

   III. Graphic display:

       Displays all aplicable entries as data points on a graph, hovering over a point displays
       its relevant data and details. There will be options to change the variable measured by the Y axis,
       but for now we feel it's most logical to keep the X axis as release date.

   IV. Display random entry (minor):

       A neat little display that will show a randomly selected title card with relevant info from 
       the dataset for an album among the 5000 in the dataset.
