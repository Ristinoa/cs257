UTF-8 notes

A byte: can represent integers
Bits: can contain either a zero or one

Patterns of bits canbe interpreted very naturally as integers

To store data in our computer that's character based: A, (), greek alphabet, ETC.

Unluke integers, these don't map to patterns of bits; so wen eed an arbitrary mapping.

ASCII -- American Standard Code for Information Interchange

Because of the A, there wasn't felt to be a great need for the greek alphabet or accented letters

All of the chracters in ASCII can be represented with only 7 bits.
