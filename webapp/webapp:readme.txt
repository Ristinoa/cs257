Publicly available dataset on kaggle.com at the above link.

STATUS: Because this is a solo project I only had time to implement two functions, an avdvanced data search and a random album selector for the homepage.

WORKING:
Random album selector
Advanced data search

NOT WORKING:
Nothing

NOTES:

During code review, other groups found that my code didn't work properly. I've repeated the "Grading" recommendations (e.g. what Professor Ondich will do to grade this project) and was able to run the app properly.
